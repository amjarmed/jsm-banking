# Project notes

## method of learining

- Jot down key concepts, tips, and any helpful commands or shortcuts mentioned.
- Write down questions that come up or areas you don’t fully understand so you can review them after the tutorial.
- At the end of each section (like a new feature or concept), summarize it briefly, either by explaining it out loud or writing a few sentences.

- Create a small guide or notes in your own words for things like the basics of React hooks, Next.js routing, API integration, etc.
- Use plain language and brief code examples to make these notes valuable as a quick reference.

- After completing the tutorial, practice by building mini-projects or features that apply what you learned, such as a to-do list, a simple blog, or a photo gallery.

- After finishing the tutorial, quickly revisit your notes and main takeaways. Reflect on any concepts that still feel unclear and consider doing a quick, targeted search or a follow-up tutorial on that specific topic.

Join online communities, such as GitHub, Discord, or Stack Overflow, where developers discuss React and Next.js. Seeing real-world discussions will deepen your understanding and provide different perspectives on how concepts are applied.

- export interface: Used for modular interfaces that need to be imported where they’re used.

- using _query-string_ for formatting balance in account
